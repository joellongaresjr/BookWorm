# BookWorm

## Description 
Welcome to "BookWorm"! This repository showcases my completion of the MERN Book Search Engine assignment, demonstrating my ability to work with modern web development technologies. I have successfully refactored a fully functioning Google Books API search engine, originally built with a RESTful API, into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The application utilizes the MERN stack, consisting of a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to search for books, save them to their account, and more.

## Learning Points
* Intergrating GraphQl using Apollo Server allowed for a more efficient and flexible way of handling data requests and mutations. GraphQL's ability to request only the required data minimizes unnecessary data transfer, enchancing application performance
* Utilizing MongoDB as NoSQL database and MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting was a significant learning experience. It showcased the importance of database management and data storeage.
